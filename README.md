# Project Overview
This is a modern frontend application leveraging React for building user interfaces, Vite for fast builds and development, and Tailwind CSS for utility-first CSS styling. The application includes a dark mode feature that enhances user experience, especially in low-light environments.

# Features
1. **React**: for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
2. **Vite**: for fast build times and an optimized development experience.
3. **Tailwind CSS**: for efficient and scalable styling.
4. **Dark/Light Mode button**: toggle for improved accessibility and user experience.
5. **Text colour of hero section**: black if in light mode, blue if in dark mode

# Getting Started

   git clone https://github.com/Samnieng1/front-end-darkmode.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. **Install the dependencies**: npm install
## Running the Applicaiton
     npm run dev

# Styling
I used Tailwind CSS for styling. The configuration can be found in the tailwind.config.js file. You can customize the theme, extend the default styles, and add plugins as needed.

## Adding Custom Styles
To add custom styles, you can use the src/index.css file or create additional CSS files and import them into your components.
